<h1>MS Word to PDF converter demo</h1>

<p>
    Please upload MS Word files in order to convert them to PDF. Please be aware: This is just a simple demo and
    files get converted synchronously during your request. If the size of your document is large, this might
    take a while. In real applications, you would probably implement an asynchronous routine on your web
    interface. The converter implementation already supports this!

    <b>Important!</b><br/>
    It seems as if this browser is running on the same machine as the converter backend. If you are opening an instance
    of MS Word (for example by opening MS Word files from this page), this might result in unexpected behavior of this
    application. Be further aware that killing the JVM that is running this application might not kill the MS Word
    processes that were opened by this application: MS Windows requires GUI processes such as MS Word to always be
    started as a child process of a MS Windows specific <em>master GUI process</em>. Therefore, MS Word processes are
    never child processes of the JVM and will therefore survive a killing of the JVM process. This converter software
    provides a shut down hook for this purpose, but shut down hooks are not triggered when a process is simply
    killed instead of shut down regularly.
